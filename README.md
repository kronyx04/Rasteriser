not gonna fix the mess on the repo, this is my garbage dump

executables always end in "_windows.exe" for windows and "_linux" for linux
they should work right out of the box
controls are arrow keys for movement, 'q' and 'e' to look to the sides

latest exes are "bnuuy_lights_windows.exe" and "bnuuy_lights_linux"
- added lights
- "removed" harlequin mode (still in the code just not in the demo)
- thats it im tires

version bun.0 "bnuuy_windows.exe" and "bnuuy_linux"
- added rabbit
- added harlequin mode
- added "better" graphics
- added readme
